# Spam-Message-Classifier

Hey there!
The following python notebook contains code for detection of spam messages received through sms or emails. The dataset used comes from Kaggle. (Link-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

I took this challange as an opportunity to train the dataset with several of the major classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes(Multinomial, Gaussian and Bernoulli), Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra trees, XG Boost, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, Bagging and K-Means Neighbours, and compare the precision and accuracy of all of them.

Multinomial Naive Bayes gave the best combination of accuracy and precision of model training.
